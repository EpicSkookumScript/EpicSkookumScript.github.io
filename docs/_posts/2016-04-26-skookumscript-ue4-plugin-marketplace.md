Hark! Do you hear the autonomous flying trumpetbots sounding from the mountain peaks of British Columbia? Do you hear our mad computer scientists’ triumphant *muahahahas* echoing in the corridors of the foreboding subterranean laboratory complex that is SkookumScript World HQ? 

Yes, you do, because today, after years of insanely dedicated refinement and preparation, the <a href="/unreal/">SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin</a> is now available as one of the first code plugins on the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/skookumscript">Unreal Marketplace</a>!

This is a stupendous moment in the history of SkookumScript—not to mention humanity—because SkookumScript is now freely available to the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a>’s two million-ish developers. Spoiler alert: They will love it! One can only imagine the mayhem that will be unleashed upon the world in the coming months and years, as UE4 developers integrate SkookumScript and its cutting-edge command console into their workflow, and wield their new-found scripting superpowers to create the greatest video games ever imagined.

Having reached this momentous milestone, we tip our iconic mad computer scientist goggles in gratitude to those who have supported us, as well as to the innocent guinea pigs we subjected to our grotesque digital experiments. Our thanks to the fine human specimens at <a href="https://epicgames.com/">Epic Games</a> for their enthusiasm and support (not to mention the lovely <a href="/blog/2015/11-18-skookumscript-awarded-15k-unreal-dev-grant/">Unreal Development Grant</a> they awarded us last fall). We look forward to the Unreal Engine and SkookumScript co-conquering the video game industry!

And even more thanks to our two intrepid cohorts of beta testers, the first of which used SkookumScript to develop <a href="/about/#sleeping-dogs">*Sleeping Dogs*</a> and <a href="http://www.sleepingdogs.net/">*Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition*</a> at <a href="http://www.unitedfrontgames.com/">United Front Games</a> in 2008-2014, and the second of which participated in our official closed beta period from January 2015 – March 2016. From indie and AAA games to medical imaging software using VR, your feedback was invaluable in the process of evolving SkookumScript from an obscure in-house tool into the terrifyingly robust product we are now releasing into the wild. SkookumScript will never stop evolving—we have years of astonishing enhancements on the way—so keep the comments and suggestions coming at the <a href="https://skookum.chat/">SkookumScript Forum</a>!

Download the SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin from the Unreal Marketplace now! (<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard">Epic Games Launcher installation required</a>). It’s free, it’s super-powerful, and it will completely, utterly, and profoundly transform your Unreal Engine experience! Have fun!
