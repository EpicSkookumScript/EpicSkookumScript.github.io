To give developers a side-by-side comparison of Blueprint graphs and SkookumScript, Markus Breyer (aka “GreatGuru”) has converted the behavior of a butterfly in the Blueprints demo project to SkookumScript.

For more on this Skookumly Skookum butterfly effect and instructions on how to download and run the butterfly demo on your computer, check out Markus’s [post in the SkookumScript forum][forum-bfly].
