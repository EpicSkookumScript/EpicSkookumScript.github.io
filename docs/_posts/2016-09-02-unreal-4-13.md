Unreal Engine 4.13 is out! 

![](/images/blog/2016-09-02_unreal-4-13-released.jpg){:.pic-full}

Since 4 is the Chinese number of death, and 13 is the bane of triskaidekaphobics everywhere, numerologically-inclined gamedevs are surely convinced that this will be the unluckiest iteration of the Unreal Engine ever.

But fear not, there is a hexadecimal cure for this hexaciousness! The mad computer scientists of the SkookumScript team would like to assure you that it is very good luck indeed to download the new, Unreal 4.13-optimized version of the SkookumScript UE4 Plugin from <a href="https://github.com/EpicSkookumScript/SkookumScript-Plugin">our GitHub repository</a>. 

The sooner you do it, the luckier you'll be! That's a mad-scientific fact.
