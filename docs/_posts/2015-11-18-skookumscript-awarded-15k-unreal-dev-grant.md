Today the SkookumScript team of mad computer scientists are giggling with substantially more glee than usual, for [Epic Games](https://epicgames.com/) has [just announced][EpicSkGrant] that it has awarded us an [Unreal Development Grant](https://www.unrealengine.com/unrealdevgrants) to support the SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin:


> SkookumScript is a text-based programming language for creating performance-critical gameplay. It’s been used in AAA games such as Sleeping Dogs, and it is now available as a free plugin for UE4. The mad scientists at Agog Labs receive an Unreal Dev Grant for their dedication.
_-- **Dana Crowley**<br>Senior Marketing Manager at [Epic Games](https://epicgames.com/)_{:.quoter}

Reached for comment in his subterranean lab somewhere in Canada, Agog Labs CEO and SkookumScript creator [Conan Reis](/about/team/#conan-reis) cackled megalomaniacally for several minutes before replying.

> This is supremely excellent news! This Unreal Dev Grant will help us achieve our diabolical goal of making SkookumScript the definitive scripting solution for Unreal Engine 4. Together, the Unreal Engine and SkookumScript will conquer the video game development world! Mua ha ha ha!
_-- [**Conan Reis**](/about/team/#conan-reis)<br>SkookumScript creator and CEO of Agog Labs Inc._{:.quoter}

Epic has been working with Agog Labs for several months to ready the SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin for release on the Unreal Marketplace—its official release date has yet to be set, but the official Agog Labs Magic 8-Ball repeatedly insists **IT IS CERTAIN**{:.mark} and **YOU MAY RELY ON IT**{:.mark}.
