The latest and greatest SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 plugin - 3.0.1703 Beta
{:.caption}

Fasten your seat belts and charge your flux capacitors—the SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin has been updated, and it’s a certified doozy! We've added a load of cool new features that integrate SkookumScript with the Unreal Engine more  deeply and smoothly than ever!

Coroutines are the heart and soul of SkookumScript, and critical to time-based flow control. Now it is easier than ever to use them in conjunction with Unreal Blueprints.

`&raw` data members allow you to use Blueprint variables just like standard SkookumScript variable syntax.

Auto-exposed Blueprint classes and Blueprint variables! Use them just like you would any other SkookumScript class or data member. Also all engine-class properties (e.g. for class `Actor`) are now data member variables.
