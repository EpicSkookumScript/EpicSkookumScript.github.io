The latest and greatest SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 plugin - 3.0.1703 Beta

Fasten your seat belts and charge your flux capacitors—the SkookumScript Unreal Engine 4 Plugin has been updated, and it’s a certified doozy! We've added a load of cool new features that integrate SkookumScript with the Unreal Engine more  deeply and smoothly than ever!

Coroutines can now be placed in your Blueprint graph and invoked from within your network!

Coroutines are the heart and soul of SkookumScript, and critical to time-based flow control. Now it is easier than ever to use them in conjunction with Unreal Blueprints.

`&raw` data members allow you to use Blueprint variables just like standard SkookumScript variable syntax.

Auto-exposed Blueprint classes and Blueprint variables! Use them just like you would any other SkookumScript class or data member. Also all engine-class properties (e.g. for class `Actor`) are now data member variables.
