SkookumScript super-user <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachburke">Zach Burke</a> (AKA error454)’s <a href="https://skookum.chat/t/the-project-formerly-known-as-arconia/721">upcoming SkookumScript game</a> is so cool, we recently gave him a demo station in the SkookumScript SkookumBooth at the 2017 Game Developers Conference to show it off. And show it off he did, impressing the industry’s movers and shakers with SkookumScript’s scripting superpowers.

A moment of blessed destruction from Zach Burke's upcoming (and provocatively untitled) SkookumScript game.

Zach isn’t done evangelizing SkookumScript as the world’s greatest scripting solution, because he has just posted a ripping good article to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ZachBurke/20170310/293425/The_Death_of_Tick_UE4__The_Future_of_Programming.php">Gamasutra</a> explaining a key SkookumScript advantage: SkookumScript users don't have to mangle their logic to fit into the classic `Tick()` architecture that has vexed game developers for decades.

> SkookumScript is an awesome programming language – it's easy to code in, it's got concurrency features built in, it's timesliced not multithreaded so you don't worry about mutexes and locking, it can call your C++, it can call blueprints, blueprints can call it, it's fast....
