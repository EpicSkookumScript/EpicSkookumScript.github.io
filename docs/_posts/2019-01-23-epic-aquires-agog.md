SkookumScript, our powerful scripting solution and command console used for game development, is now owned by Epic Games and remains available as a community-supported plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 4. It will now use the same [license as Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula).

> Here at Agog Labs our goal has always been to create authoring and development tools that allow people to focus on bringing their passionate imaginings to life. We melt our brains so you don't have to. Epic has the same goals and spark of mad science, which makes it easy to align our paths. We're honored to become part of the Epic family.
