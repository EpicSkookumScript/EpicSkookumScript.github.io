Welcome to our splendid and ever-growing trove of SkookumScript documentation! Whether you are a high-level scripter, low-level engine coder, mid-level jack-of-all-trades or miscellaneous dabbler, here ye shall find a comprehensive guide to SkookumScript and the SkookumSuite.

In addition to the pages in this section, see [Show me some code!](/about/look/) for examples of SkookumScript [syntax] and brief yet evocative descriptions of the language. See SkookumScript code and tools in action in the video demo on the [home page](/).

## Looking for table of contents or map?

On every page the contents of the SkookumScript docs including the rest of the site can be found to the left "On this site" sidebar (or the top left "Site" hamburger sidebar dropdown when the page width is narrow such as on mobile). Longer pages also have a "On this page" sidebar on the right (or the top right "Page" hamburger sidebar dropdown when the page is narrow).

You can jump directly into learning SkookumScript by reading the [SkookumScript Primer](/docs/v3.0/) or go through each page in the docs from top to bottom clicking on **Next >>**{:.tip} and **<< Previous**{:.tip} as needed.
