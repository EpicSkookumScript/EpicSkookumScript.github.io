- It's the zombie apocalypse and you only have time to mash keys and hope for the best.
- This is an ancient link that no longer exists or has moved.
- The page you thought was here... doesn't exist and never did.
- You are actively trying out random links to find interesting stuff.
- The page _does_ exist and the link has a typo or copy-paste error.
- The link was generated from some algorithm which has an _off by one error_ that needs debugging. [Or it could be a memory stomp from that _other_ coder/team on the project.]
