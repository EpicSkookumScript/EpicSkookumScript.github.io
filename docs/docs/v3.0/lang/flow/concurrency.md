Additional information on coroutines and structured concurrency is coming. In the meantime, see these concurrency-related posts on the [SkookumScript Forum](https://skookum.chat/):


### Concurrent commands

### `Mind` objects and the `Master` `Mind`

Minds are used to manage and update coroutines, and encapsulate logical components of gameplay such levels, missions, minigames, squad AI, and group behaviors. Mind objects also often act as a starting or entry point for code.

Additional information on `Mind` objects can be found in these forum posts:
